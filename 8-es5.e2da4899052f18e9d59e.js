Nevertheless, both the design of the program which consists of lectures on Mondays and the exercise sessions with 12 students, and our trainers who allocate their spare time to our learning and employ rather simplistic and easy-to-grasp language made me realize that my thoughts regarding Python were just prejudice. Furthermore, the program is very lucrative in adopting participant oriented approach; the entire lecture in the Lab is projected on 4 screens, each lecture and solutions to the problems are promptly made available online and 4 of our lecturers are at our disposal either throughout the class or email.
