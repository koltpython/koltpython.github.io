The program is designed for students with no\r\n      programming experience and assumes no technical background. In parallel with KOLT’s mission, we value\r\n      <strong>active student engagement</strong> and try to create an environment where both the learner and the peer as\r\n      an instructor can actively engage with the content and each other. We prioritize\r\n      <strong>practical use cases </strong> of programming over more theoretical aspects and encourage students to\r\n      leverage their programming skills in their field or interests during and after the program.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2>Our Goals</h2>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>\r\n        Provide a <strong>safe</strong> learning environment for students from every background to gain their first\r\n        programming experience.\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        Teach practical programming skills to interested students where each student can further excel and leverage\r\n        their newly gained programming skills in their field or interests.\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        Establish a unique environment for Koç students who are interested in teaching where they can experience every\r\n        aspect of teaching including giving lectures to crowded audiences and improve their teaching skills utilizing\r\n        peer-support.\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>Create high quality and open source educational content.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <h2>About Certificate Program</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n      KOLT Python Certificate program is a 12 week long journey that aims to provide students with an understanding of\r\n      the role programming can play in solving problems and to help students, regardless of their major, rely on their\r\n      ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish social, civic, professional and personal valuable\r\n      goals.

Apart from lacking any sort of knowledge about computer programming, the mere text-based education\r\n      that I have obtained in the past years led me to question whether I would have been capable of learning the\r\n      programming or not. Nevertheless, both the design of the program which consists of lectures on Mondays and the\r\n      exercise sessions with 12 students, and our trainers who allocate their spare time to our learning and employ\r\n      rather simplistic and easy-to-grasp language made me realize that my thoughts regarding Python were just\r\n      prejudice. Furthermore, the program is very lucrative in adopting participant oriented approach; the entire\r\n      lecture in the Lab is projected on 4 screens, each lecture and solutions to the problems are promptly made\r\n      available online and 4 of our lecturers are at our disposal either throughout the class or email. This\r\n      participant-centered approach surely facilitates asking the questions that most of us label as “embarrassing”.\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    Mısra Taşçı, Freshman Medical Student, Spring 2019\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n      I'm a medical student and this is my first year. I am very interested in programming and this program is really\r\n      great for me because it is like a serious course but it is fun and without the stress of exams. Also our\r\n      instructors are very nice and helpful, and I really love the assignments that they prepare, time really passes\r\n      quickly when I try doing them. I would love it if there were more programs like this about other subjects that I'm\r\n      interested in.\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    Petrus Johannes Gerrits, PhD Candidate in Archeology, Spring 2019\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n      The KOLT Python certificate program has been very useful for me so far. I studied Archaeology for my undergraduate\r\n      and graduate studies and my hope is that with the content of this course I can make use of Python programming more\r\n      regularly. The instructors are great, they make learning Python understandable, respond quickly to questions and\r\n      assist whenever needed.\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n","import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\r\nimport { HomeComponent } from './home.component';\r\nimport { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';\r\nimport { MaterialModule } from '../material/material.module';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [HomeComponent],\r\n  imports: [CommonModule, RouterModule.forChild([{ path: '', component: HomeComponent }]), MaterialModule]\r\n})\r\nexport class HomeModule {}\r\n"],"sourceRoot":"webpack:///"}
