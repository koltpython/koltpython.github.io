    KOLT Python program is founded by Ahmet Uysal in collaboration with
    <a href="//kolt.ku.edu.tr">Ko√ß University Office of Learning and Teaching</a> in September 2018 to address students'
    raising demand for programming. The program is designed for students with no programming experience and assumes no
    technical background. We prioritize practical use cases of programming over more theoretical aspects and encourage
    students to leverage their programming skills in their field or interests.

    In Spring 2019, we accepted our first 20 students from various academic principles. The program is ever-growing and
    improving since then thanks to our passionate team members and feedback from our students.
