    <h2>About KOLT Python</h2>
    <p>
      KOLT Python is founded by Ahmet Uysal in collaboration with
      <a href="https://kolt.ku.edu.tr">Koç University Office of Learning and Teaching</a> in September 2018 to address
      students' rising demand for programming. The program is designed for students with no programming experience and
      assumes no technical background. In parallel with KOLT’s mission, we value
      <strong>active student engagement</strong> and try to create an environment where both the learner and the teacher
      can actively engage with the content and each other. We prioritize <strong>practical use cases </strong> of
      programming over more theoretical aspects and encourage students to leverage their programming skills in their
      field or interests during and after the program.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Provide a risk-free way for students from nontechnical backgrounds to gain their first programming experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        Teach practical programming skills to interested students where each student can further excel and leverage
        their newly gained programming skills in their field or interests.
      </li>
      <li>
        Establish a unique environment for Koç students who are interested in teaching where they can experience every
        aspect of teaching including giving lectures to crowded audiences.
      </li>
      <li>Create high quality and open source educational content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About Certificate Program</h2>
    <p>
      KOLT Python Certificate program is a 12 week long journey that aims to provide students with an understanding of
      the role programming can play in solving problems and to help students, regardless of their major, feel
      justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. To get
      more detailed information about the program, you can view the
